# Codeforces – Competitive Programming Repository 🚀

This repository is my public competitive programming space.  
It contains both **official contest submissions** and **practice problems**, showing
my growth in algorithms, problem solving, and implementation discipline.

---

## 📂 Structure
- **contests/** – solutions from Codeforces contests
- **practice/** – standalone problems solved outside contests (learning, revisiting concepts, experiments, drafts)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build strong algorithmic thinking
- Improve speed + accuracy under contest pressure
- Develop clean, maintainable competitive code
- Track progress transparently

---

## 🛠️ Tech
- Language: **C++ (20/23)**  
- Build: simple g++ / CMake when needed  
- Environment: Linux / Windows

---

## ✅ Notes
✔ Some folders include brief explanations or learning notes  
✔ Not every solution is perfect; mistakes are part of progress  
✔ Feedback is always welcome 🙂
